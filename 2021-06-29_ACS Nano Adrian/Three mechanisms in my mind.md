Since we observed phase changes between BPI and BPII in the polymer-stabilized droplet experiments, we consider several mechanisms that may facilitate the rearrangement of their arrays of disclination lines. First, we recall that the UV irradiation occurs under conditions favorable to BPI formation. Computer simulations show that the disclination lines from BPI change shape, touch and recombine to produce the BPII defect structure. This can be achieved if the polymers follow the defect rearrangement but do not produce new cross-links at the recombination points: this would leave the BPII defect structure free to revert back to the earlier configuration without tearing.  Second, polymer structures formed by UV irradiation have been characterized as semi-interpenetrated polymer networks (semi-IPN) [Joo 2007, Athawale 2003]. For such networks, the conditions of irradiation can affect the ability of polymer to form a fully defect-spanning scaffold: for instance, for long irradiation conditions it has been shown by Johansson et al (2020) that semi-IPN display a decrease in their elastic moduli, which they attribute to chain scission. In addition, semi-IPN can display phase incompatibilities between their components, with one of them being more mobile than the other [Athawale 2003]. This could lead to a situation where the more mobile component could migrate to the disclination-line recombination zones, thus reducing the free energy of the whole assembly without tearing.  These possible mechanisms may be explored and tested experimentally in subsequent work.
